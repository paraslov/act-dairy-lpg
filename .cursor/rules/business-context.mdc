# Life RPG Concept Based on ACT and _The Happiness Trap_

## 1. Core Idea

This is a Life RPG where the goal is **not** to slay a dragon, but to build a **rich, full, and meaningful life while making room for the inevitable pain that comes with it**.

Instead of traditional HP/MP, the main “stats” of the character are **psychological skills** from **ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy)**.

The player learns to:

- **accept** inner difficulties instead of fighting them,
- and **act in line with their values**, even when it is uncomfortable.

The game uses original ACT terminology (in English) and ideas from _The Happiness Trap_.

---

## 2. Character Skills & Abilities (ACT Processes as Skills)

The character develops **six core ACT processes** instead of magic or physical strength. Each process is a skill that can be trained and leveled up.

### 2.1. Acceptance

**Acceptance** – the ability to **open up** to unpleasant emotions and sensations instead of fighting or suppressing them.

In-game:

- High **Acceptance** lets the hero “switch off the struggle switch”.
- When hit by “emotional damage” (e.g., Anxiety Monster), the hero:
  - does **not** lose HP immediately,
  - but “holds” the discomfort and stays functional.

- Acceptance reduces useless resistance and keeps the character able to move toward values.

---

### 2.2. Cognitive Defusion

**Cognitive Defusion** – the ability to **step back from thoughts**, seeing them as words and stories, not as literal truths or commands.

In-game:

- Defusion is a skill that **disperses mental illusions** created by monsters.
- Example: when attacked by the Inner Critic saying “I’m a loser”, a character with high Defusion:
  - recognizes it as “I’m having the thought that I’m a loser”,
  - and does **not** change behavior based on this thought alone.

- Mechanically: Defusion reduces the effect duration and power of debuffs like **Fear**, **Negative Thinking**, **Self-Doubt**, etc.

---

### 2.3. Mindfulness / Contact with the Present Moment

**Mindfulness (Contact with the Present Moment)** – the ability to be **here and now**, fully engaged with the current situation.

In-game:

- Mindfulness functions as a **Focus Mode**:
  - While active, the hero is resistant to **distracting attacks** (worries about the future, rumination about the past).
  - Increases XP gained from actions, because the hero performs them consciously.

- It helps the character notice early signs of **fusion** and **avoidance** before they hijack behavior.

---

### 2.4. Self-as-Context (Observing Self)

**Self-as-Context (Observing Self)** – the ability to experience oneself as the **observer** of all thoughts, feelings, and sensations, rather than being defined by them.

In-game:

- This skill gives the hero a **stable sense of identity**:
  - “I am not my thoughts or emotions.”

- Attacks like **Confusion** or **Identity Crisis** deal less damage.
- Mechanically: when activated, the camera metaphorically “zooms out”:
  - the player sees the character and their thoughts/emotions as separate elements on screen.

- This reduces reactivity and supports Acceptance and Defusion.

---

### 2.5. Values

**Values** – the **heart of the game**.

Values are **chosen life directions**, like:

- Family
- Creativity
- Health
- Learning
- Helping others
- Authenticity, etc.

In-game:

- At the start, the player goes through a **Value Discovery** flow:
  - explores: “What kind of person do I want to be?”
  - selects key values that become their **Values Compass**.

- Every main quest line is linked to one or more **values**.
- Values define **where the character is heading**, not what they must “achieve”.
- A high **Values skill** means:
  - clarity about what matters,
  - and better navigation when facing fear, doubt, or temptations.

---

### 2.6. Committed Action

**Committed Action** – the ability to take **effective, value-based action**, even in the presence of difficult thoughts and feelings.

In-game:

- Committed Action defines the character’s ability to:
  - start quests,
  - stick with them,
  - finish them despite obstacles.

- It powers **Action Planning**: breaking big value-based goals into concrete steps.
- High Committed Action = more **toward moves** (see below) and fewer drops due to procrastination or avoidance.

---

## 3. Character Stats

Character Stats: Light and Shadow

In this ACT-based life RPG, the player’s character is defined not only by “positive” psychological skills, but also by their “shadow” counterparts.

Positive stats represent stable skills the player has developed.

They never decrease; they either grow or stay the same.

Once you’ve learned defusion or acceptance, that capacity is there, even if you don’t use it all the time.

Shadow stats represent how much the character is currently caught in old, unhelpful patterns.

They increase with away moves (actions driven by avoidance, fusion, autopilot, etc.).

They decrease with toward moves (values-based actions) and specific in-game practices.

This way the player can see both growth and regression clearly:
skills can be high and the shadows can temporarily flare up when life gets hard.

Core Stat Pairs

Each core ACT process is represented as a pair: a light stat (skill) and a shadow stat (its counterpart).

3.1. Psychological Flexibility / Psychological Inflexibility

Psychological Flexibility
The main “global” stat of the character. It reflects the ability to stay present, open up to inner experience, and act in line with personal values.
High Psychological Flexibility means the character can adapt to difficulties, feel what they feel, and still choose effective, values-based actions.

Psychological Inflexibility
The shadow counterpart: how much the character is currently trapped in rigid, unhelpful patterns — dominated by avoidance, fusion, and automatic reactions.
A higher Psychological Inflexibility score makes other shadow stats more impactful and increases the chance of getting stuck or derailed by internal experiences.

3.2. Acceptance / Experiential Avoidance

Acceptance / Willingness
Measures the character’s readiness to experience discomfort in the service of what matters.
High Acceptance means the character can carry fear, pain, or shame along for the journey without shutting down or fighting their inner world.

Experiential Avoidance
The shadow stat: how strongly the character is trying to get rid of or escape from unwanted thoughts and feelings.
Experiential Avoidance grows when the player consistently chooses away moves to dodge discomfort (numbing, distraction, procrastination instead of facing what matters).
It shrinks when the player does small, values-based actions while allowing discomfort to be there.

3.3 Cognitive Defusion / Cognitive Fusion

Cognitive Defusion
The skill of seeing thoughts as thoughts – words, images, and stories – rather than literal truths or commands.
High Defusion means the character can notice thoughts like “I’m a failure” without automatically believing or obeying them.

Cognitive Fusion
The shadow: how entangled the character is with their thoughts right now.
When Cognitive Fusion is high, the character treats thoughts as facts, gets hooked by mental stories, and behaves as if the mind is always right.
Fusion grows when the character repeatedly cancels quests or actions because of thoughts like “I can’t”, “It’s pointless”, or “I’ll be judged”.
It decreases when the player uses in-game defusion techniques and still acts according to values.

3.4. Mindfulness / Autopilot

Mindfulness (Focus)
Represents the ability to connect with the present moment and fully engage with what is happening here and now.
High Mindfulness improves the effectiveness of all actions: quests completed with high focus grant more experience and better outcomes.

Autopilot (Mindlessness)
The shadow stat: how much the character is running on automatic, disconnected from the present.
High Autopilot means reacting instead of choosing, scrolling instead of participating, zoning out instead of engaging.
Autopilot rises when the player repeatedly goes through days and quests mechanically, avoiding awareness.
It drops when the player practices short in-game mindfulness exercises or completes quests consciously and intentionally.

3.5. Values Alignment / Values Disconnection

Values Alignment
Shows how closely the character’s actions are aligned with their chosen values.
It can be tracked globally and per value (e.g., Health, Relationships, Creativity).
High Values Alignment provides bonuses to motivation, recovery after setbacks, and unlocks deeper story events connected to meaning and fulfillment.

Values Disconnection (Values Drift)
The shadow side: how far the character has drifted away from what truly matters to them.
Values Disconnection increases when the player frequently chooses short-term comfort or fear-driven decisions over what they’ve declared as important.
It decreases when the player takes even small, concrete steps in each values area, reinforcing the link between intention and action.

3.6. Committed Action / Avoidant Inaction

Committed Action
Measures the character’s ability to take consistent, values-based steps, even in the presence of fear, doubt, or discomfort.
High Committed Action means more quests get completed, fewer projects die halfway, and the character can translate insight into behavior.

Avoidant Inaction (Stuckness)
The shadow: how much the character is currently stuck in non-doing, delay, or impulsive detours that serve avoidance rather than values.
Avoidant Inaction grows when quests aligned with values are repeatedly postponed, abandoned, or replaced with easy, numbing activities.
It shrinks when the player starts and finishes small, realistic actions that move the character toward their values, even if those steps are tiny.

This dual-stat system lets the player see both sides of their psychological journey:

Positive stats show what skills they have built over time.

Shadow stats show how much old patterns are active right now.

Together they paint a clear picture of both long-term growth and current struggles, which fits perfectly with ACT’s focus on psychological flexibility in the real, messy flow of life.

## 4. Quests & Level Progression

The storyline is structured around **values**. Each major value becomes a **quest line**, showing how it can be lived out.

Progress is measured not by gold or loot, but by **movement toward values**.

### 4.1. Value Discovery Quest

**Quest: “Value Discovery”**

- Intro quest that helps the player identify what truly matters.
- Presented as a journey to a **Hall of Values** or a meeting with a wise NPC.
- The player answers questions like:
  - “What kind of person do you want to be?”
  - “What do you want your life to stand for?”

- Reward: **Values Compass** – a permanent UI element showing key life directions.

---

### 4.2. Values-Driven Main Quest Lines

Each key value has its own main quest line. Examples:

- **Creativity – “The Artist’s Journey”**
  - Write a chapter of a book.
  - Finish a project.
  - Share the work with the world (symbolically).
  - Fight monsters like **Procrastination**, **Self-Doubt**, **Perfectionism**.

- **Relationships – “Bridge of Empathy”**
  - Initiate honest conversations.
  - Repair a conflict.
  - Show vulnerability.
  - Confront monsters like **Pride**, **Fear of Rejection**, **Shame**.

Completing quests in a value line grants:

- **Value XP** for that value,
- higher **Values Alignment**,
- sometimes special traits or items tied to that value.

---

### 4.3. Side Quests: “Facing Demons”

These optional quests focus on specific ACT skills.

Examples:

- **“Quicksand Bog” (Acceptance training)**
  - The hero falls into emotional quicksand.
  - Struggling (moving violently, trying to escape) makes them sink deeper.
  - To escape, the player must:
    - stop struggling,
    - open up to the sensation of sinking,
    - relax and spread arms (metaphor for Acceptance),
    - slowly float up and move to values.

- **“Thought Defusion Lab” (Defusion training)**
  - Illusory maze created by thoughts.
  - Negative phrases appear on walls and screens.
  - Player uses Defusion techniques:
    - renaming thoughts (“I’m having the thought that…”),
    - saying them in a funny voice,
    - watching them float away.

  - Success: illusions lose power, paths become visible.

Reward: +1 to the relevant skill (Acceptance, Defusion, etc.) and symbolic items, e.g. **“Leaf of Mindfulness”** (reference to “Leaves on a stream” exercise).

---

### 4.4. Daily Mini-Quests (Life Journal Mode)

The game includes a **daily quest system** linked to real life.

Each day, the player receives small tasks such as:

- “Make one toward move: spend 10 minutes on an avoided but important task.”
- “Have a mindful conversation with a loved one (Relationships value).”
- “Do one action for Health (walk, stretch, drink water mindfully).”

The player marks completion in a **Values Journal**:

- Completing daily quests:
  - gives XP and cosmetic rewards,
  - increases **Values Alignment** and **Committed Action**.

- If a quest is missed:
  - no harsh punishment,
  - the game suggests reflecting:
    - “What got in the way?”
    - “What can be a smaller step next time?”

This builds **self-compassion** into the gameplay.

---

### 4.5. Level Up via Psychological Growth

The character levels up by accumulating **XP from mindful, value-based actions**.

Examples:

- To reach Level 2:
  - perform N **toward moves**.

- When leveling up:
  - parts of the game world are freed from the **Happiness Trap fog**.
  - new skills, quests, and areas unlock:
    - e.g., Level 5: **Observing Self Sanctuary** becomes available.
    - Level 10: access to the final boss fight.

---

### 4.6. Final Quest: “Escape the Happiness Trap”

Endgame story arc:

- The hero faces the main boss: **The Happiness Trap**.
- The boss promises:
  - “You can be happy all the time.”
  - “Avoid pain at any cost.”

- The boss tempts the player to abandon values in exchange for comfort and safety.

To win, the hero must:

1. Use **Acceptance** to open up to fear and discomfort.
2. Use **Defusion** to step back from the boss’s seductive thoughts.
3. Recall their **Values** and **Committed Action**.
4. Take a value-based action **in the presence of fear**, not after eliminating it.

Victory = the character **escapes the Happiness Trap mindset**:

- Understands that a meaningful life includes pain,
- chooses to keep moving toward values instead of chasing constant comfort.

After the final quest, the game continues in **open-world mode**:

- new challenges still appear (emotions, thoughts, setbacks),
- but the player now has functioning ACT skills to handle them.

---

## 5. Obstacles & Monsters

Internal struggles are represented as enemies, traps, and hostile environments.

### 5.1. Experiential Avoidance Monster

**Experiential Avoidance** – the habit of **trying to get rid of or avoid inner experiences at any cost**.

In-game:

- The Avoidance Monster whispers:
  - “Run away.”
  - “Numb this feeling.”
  - “Distract yourself, don’t feel this.”

- Each time the player chooses avoidance (an **away move**):
  - the monster grows stronger,
  - short-term relief appears,
  - but quests do not progress, and future tasks become harder.

- Counterplay:
  - recognize avoidance,
  - use Acceptance,
  - and take at least a **small toward move**.

---

### 5.2. Cognitive Fusion Fog

**Cognitive Fusion Fog** – an environment where the hero fuses with thoughts.

In-game:

- When entering zones like **Dense Forest of Thoughts**, the character:
  - gets a **Fusion debuff**,
  - sees intrusive thought-messages on screen (“You will fail”, “You are not good enough”),
  - controls may be partially hijacked.

- Using Defusion:
  - pressing a button like **“I’m having the thought that…”** transforms the text.
  - e.g., “I’m a failure” → “I’m having the thought that I’m a failure”.

- This reduces the fog temporarily, allowing progress.
- Fog can never be removed forever (thoughts always return), but the player learns not to take it literally.

---

### 5.3. Inner Critic

**The Inner Critic** – boss or recurring enemy that personifies self-criticism, shame, and “not good enough” stories.

In-game:

- Appears as:
  - a harsh mentor,
  - a shadow version of the hero,
  - or a mirror reflection.

- Attacks with combined:
  - **Fusion** (“This thought is the truth about you”),
  - and **Avoidance** (“Give up, don’t even try”).

- To defeat the Inner Critic, the player:
  - uses Defusion to see critical messages as thoughts,
  - uses Acceptance to allow shame and hurt,
  - keeps taking **Committed Action** in line with values.

- The Critic never disappears completely, but:
  - each victory reduces its power,
  - its lines become less convincing.

---

### 5.4. Monsters of Emotion

Different **emotion-monsters**:

- **Anxiety** – trembling shadow with many eyes.
- **Anger** – fiery beast.
- **Sadness** – heavy, slow-moving ghost.

In-game:

- The goal is **not** to kill these monsters,
- but to **change relationship** with them.

Example:

- A novice hero fights Anxiety with **avoidance sword**:
  - runs away,
  - suppresses feelings,
  - avoids situations.

- Result:
  - Anxiety Monster grows and returns stronger.

- The game teaches:
  - use Acceptance (“Expand”, “Make space”),
  - walk past the monster while it talks,
  - continue value-based quest anyway.

- “Victory” is:
  - Anxiety still exists,
  - but no longer controls behavior.

---

### 5.5. Everyday Happiness Traps

Small traps that offer immediate pleasure but pull the hero away from values:

- **Comfort Cloud** – a soft cloud where the hero can rest and “feel good now”, but:
  - time skips,
  - important quests are delayed.

- **Mirror of Social Comparison** – shows other heroes’ “perfect lives”:
  - stepping into it triggers feelings of envy and inferiority,
  - the hero may start chasing someone else’s values.

The game shows consequences:

- resources lost,
- progress toward own values stalled.

But it also always offers a way back:

- recognition: “This is a happiness trap,”
- and a chance to take a new **toward move**.

---

## 6. Progress Tracking: Toward Moves vs Away Moves

Progress is tracked not just via levels, but via **behavioral choices**.

Any meaningful moment in the game is a **Choice Point**:

- the player either takes a **Toward Move** (toward values),
- or an **Away Move** (away from values, into avoidance or comfort).

### 6.1. Choice Points

In quests:

- A situation is marked as a **Choice Point**.
- Example:
  - Help a friend (Relationships value) vs. avoid him out of fear of rejection.

- If the player chooses the value-consistent action **despite discomfort**:
  - it counts as a **Toward Move**,
  - the player gets:
    - XP,
    - Values Alignment increase,
    - possibly a special **Value Token**.

- If the player chooses avoidance:
  - short-term relief,
  - but long-term cost:
    - slight drop in Values Alignment,
    - states like **Regret** or **Guilt**,
    - eventual reappearance of similar situations.

---

### 6.2. Values Journal

The game contains a **Values Journal** which acts both as:

- an in-game diary,
- and a reflection tool.

At the end of each in-game (or real) day:

- the player marks:
  - which actions were **Toward Moves**,
  - which were **Away Moves**,
  - and which values they served or avoided.

- UI:
  - graphs,
  - bull’s eye target,
  - charts per value (Family, Work, Health, etc.).

This encourages:

- building awareness of daily choices,
- developing a habit of checking against values.

---

### 6.3. Stats & Achievements

The game keeps counters for:

- total **Toward Moves**,
- total **Away Moves**.

Achievements examples:

- **“Values Champion I”** – 7 days in a row with more Toward than Away moves.
- **“Mindful Responder”** – 50 moments where the player noticed an avoidance impulse and chose a small Toward Move instead.

If a streak breaks:

- the game responds with **support**, not punishment:
  - “Everyone makes away moves sometimes. What matters is your next step.”

---

### 6.4. Adaptive Feedback

If the player does many Away Moves in a row:

- the story adapts:
  - a mentor NPC appears,
  - offers a quest like **“Small Steps Forward”**:
    - propose tiny, manageable toward actions to rebuild confidence.

If the player keeps making Toward Moves:

- they may unlock positive events:
  - NPCs expressing gratitude,
  - new opportunities that “unexpectedly” appear as a result of sustained valued action.

This keeps the focus on:

- direction (values),
- patterns (toward/away),
- and growth of **Psychological Flexibility** over time.

---

This design turns ACT and _The Happiness Trap_ into a **playable metaphor**:

- **Values** → main axis of the game world
- **ACT processes** → character skills and stats
- **Internal struggles** → monsters and traps
- **Toward/Away moves** → core behavior mechanic and progress metric

The goal: help the player experience, through gameplay, what it means to **accept inner demons and follow their heart**, one quest at a time.
