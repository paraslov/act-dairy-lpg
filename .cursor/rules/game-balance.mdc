Gamified Experience and Level System Design Progression Layers and Key Concepts This system uses three interconnected layers of progress to gamify personal development: Personal Values (Sub-Values): Specific user-chosen values (e.g. honesty, creativity, fitness) under broader categories. These are the most granular level, tracking progress 1:1 with actions. Core Values (Base Values): Four fundamental life domains – for example, Love, Health, Work, Play. Each personal value maps to one of these core categories. Progress here is slower, reflecting more long-term growth in each life domain. Global Level (Path Level): An overall character level representing the user’s life journey progress. This level increases as the user makes value-driven actions over time. It’s an infinite, ever-growing level. Character Stats: Six psychological skill indicators (e.g. Acceptance vs Experiential Avoidance) representing the user’s mental and behavioral skills. Each has a “light” (positive) and “shadow” (negative) side. Stats are numerical and grow with experience, without a fixed cap. “Shadow” Progress: Parallel tracking for moves that go against values (away moves). Shadow XP is accumulated for Core Values, Path, and stats separately, indicating the “dark side” or values-discrepant actions. Integrity Rating (Overall Score): A single power score that combines all of the above – reflecting the user’s overall alignment with values and personal growth. It adds up positive progress (Path Level, core value ranks, positive stats) and subtracts the shadow side to give an at-a-glance rating. All these layers work together to provide feedback on both values-based actions (toward moves) and away moves, giving the user a comprehensive view of their journey. Personal Values Progression (Sub-Values) Each personal value (the specific values defined by the user) has its own progression track with ranks and experience points (XP). This is the most direct and fast-changing layer, as every small action toward a value immediately contributes XP to that value. Base Unit – Value XP: The smallest unit of experience is 1 Value XP, roughly corresponding to one small values-based action (one toward move). For example, completing a minor task in service of a value (like a kind gesture for the value “Compassion”) might give +1 Value XP to that personal value. Ranks and Titles for Personal Values Progress is broken into ranks with thematic titles, indicating how advanced that value is in the user’s life. The ranks for personal values are: Common – starting rank (beginner). Rare Elite Legendary Mythic Ascended – after Mythic, representing an exceptional level of commitment. Ascended ★1 to ★5: five star levels beyond Ascended, showing continued advancement before the next title. Enlightenment – the pinnacle rank, achieved after Ascended ★5. Enlightenment then continues with numeric levels (Enlightenment 1, 2, 3, …) infinitely. Each rank requires accumulating a certain total of Value XP for that personal value. Early ranks are deliberately easy to reach (to give quick wins), while later ranks take progressively more effort. XP Requirements per Rank (Personal Values) The XP system is designed to be linear-incremental – each rank requires more XP than the previous, but the increase is steady (not an exponential spike). This keeps progress feeling fair and understandable. Below is an example XP progression for one personal value: Common: 0 XP – Every value starts at Common with 0 XP. Rare: +50 XP (50 total) – Requires about 50 XP. This is a very attainable goal (e.g. roughly one week of consistent small actions, if the user earns ~5–10 XP per day). Elite: +100 XP (150 total) – Requires an additional 100 XP after Rare (total 150). At ~5–10 toward actions per day, this might take a couple more weeks beyond Rare. Legendary: +150 XP (300 total) – Another 150 XP on top of Elite. Mythic: +200 XP (500 total) – Another 200 XP after Legendary, totaling 500. With consistent effort (around +5 XP daily), a dedicated user can reach Mythic on a particular value in roughly 2 months (give or take) of daily practice. Ascended (no star): +250 XP (750 total) – Achieved after accumulating 750 XP in the value. This might be on the order of 3–4 months of regular practice for that value. Ascended ★1: +300 XP (1050 total) Ascended ★2: +350 XP (1400 total) Ascended ★3: +400 XP (1800 total) Ascended ★4: +450 XP (2250 total) Ascended ★5: +500 XP (2750 total) – Each star level requires slightly more XP (+50 more than the previous increment). Reaching Ascended ★5 is a long-term achievement, representing 2,750 total XP in one value (on the order of a year or more of consistent effort). Enlightenment 1: +100 XP (2850 total) – After Ascended ★5, the progression “resets” to a simpler growth pattern. The next level needs only about 100 XP. Enlightenment 2: +110 XP (2960 total) Enlightenment 3: +120 XP (etc.) – Each subsequent Enlightenment level increases the requirement by a small amount (e.g. +10 XP more than the previous). This provides infinite progression beyond Ascended that remains achievable in reasonable steps. The XP needed slowly grows (100, 110, 120, 130, …), preventing the requirements from becoming impossibly large, while still demanding a bit more over time. Why this design? Early on, ranks come quickly (Common → Rare in about a week of play) to motivate the user. As the user advances, ranks become milestones that require sustained effort (e.g. Mythic might take a couple of months of dedication to that value). By the time the user hits Enlightenment, they have essentially “prestiged” that value – at which point the progression switches to an ongoing leveling system with relatively small incremental steps (keeping the user engaged with continuous, albeit slow, progress indefinitely). Toward vs. Away for Personal Values Toward moves: Every toward move (action aligned with that value) yields +XP for the corresponding personal value. These directly help the value rank up. (If an action is relevant to multiple personal values, it could award XP to each relevant value – this can be configured, but typically an action is primarily tied to one value.) Away moves: There is no “shadow rank” for personal sub-values. If the user takes an action that goes against a particular personal value (an away move), it simply does not earn XP for that value (or may give a greatly reduced amount). We do not subtract XP or de-level personal values for away moves – progress gained isn’t lost. The consequences of away moves are instead reflected in the Core Values and shadow stats (described below). This way, a user’s specific value level never goes down; it only goes up as they accumulate positive actions (the negative actions will show up in other parts of the system). Core Values Progression (Love, Health, Work, Play) Core Values represent broad life domains. All personal values are grouped under one of these four (or however many core categories the system uses). For example, personal values like “Honesty” or “Family” might fall under the core value Love/Relationships; a value like “Fitness” or “Self-Care” under Health, etc. Progress in core values reflects a higher-level view of the user’s life alignment in that domain. Because core values cover more ground, they level up more slowly than individual personal values. Ranks and Titles for Core Values Core Values use the same rank titles as personal values: Common, Rare, Elite, Legendary, Mythic, Ascended (★1–★5), Enlightenment. This parallel structure makes it easy for the user to understand (e.g. both personal values and core values have a Rare rank, etc.), and emphasizes that one can achieve “Legendary Health” or “Mythic Work” as cumulative accomplishments. However, the XP required for core value ranks is higher, since progress is aggregated and slower. XP Requirements and Scaling for Core Values We tie the core value XP requirements to the personal value requirements, using a multiplier. In this refined system, let’s use a 6× factor for core values relative to personal values: XP Multiplier ~6×: Any given rank threshold for a Core Value is about 6 times the equivalent threshold for a personal value. (This is an adjustment from an earlier idea of 12×, which was deemed too slow for practical progress.) Concretely, if a personal value needed 50 XP to reach Rare, the corresponding core value (for the domain that personal value falls under) needs roughly 50×6 = 300 XP to reach Rare. Similarly: Personal Elite: 150 XP → Core Elite: 150×6 = 900 XP. Personal Legendary: 300 XP → Core Legendary: 1800 XP. Personal Mythic: 500 XP → Core Mythic: 3000 XP. Personal Ascended (no star): 750 XP → Core Ascended: 4500 XP. …and so on (each subsequent requirement for core is 6× the personal value’s requirement for that rank). These numbers can be tuned, but the goal is that core values level up several times slower than individual values. For example, while a personal value might go from Common to Rare in a week, a core value might take on the order of a month or more of consistent effort in that domain to go from Common to Rare. This feels logical – broad life domains change more slowly than specific habits. XP accumulation: Each toward action that gives 1 XP to a personal value will also give XP to the corresponding Core Value. Since we’ve set a 6× difference in thresholds, one simple approach is to award +1 Core Value XP for each toward move in that domain, and let the higher threshold do the scaling. (In other words, we don’t need to give fractional XP.) For example, doing a healthy action (+1 XP to a “Fitness” personal value under Health) also gives +1 XP to Health core value. Thus, roughly 300 health-related actions (over time) would make Health hit Rare rank. If the user spreads their 5–10 daily actions across different core domains, each core will advance more slowly – but focused effort in one domain will level that domain faster. Note: The exact multiplier (6× here) can be adjusted to calibrate the pace. A smaller factor (e.g. 5×) would speed up core leveling; a larger factor (e.g. 8×) would slow it down. We choose ~6× as a balanced starting point so that Core Rare rank might be achieved in a couple of months of dedicated work, and Core Mythic on the scale of a year or more – making those higher core ranks significant life achievements. Light (Toward) vs Shadow (Away) in Core Values Every Core Value has two XP counters and ranks: one for value-consistent actions (light side), and one for value-violating actions (shadow side). Toward XP (Light): This accumulates when the user takes actions that honor that core value. For instance, exercising or getting good sleep adds toward XP to Health. Away XP (Shadow): This accumulates when the user’s actions go against that core value. For example, a lapse like smoking a cigarette or pulling an all-nighter might add away XP to Health’s shadow side (since it undermines health). Each side has its own rank progression using the same titles: A core value could be Legendary on the light side (from lots of positive actions) but perhaps only Rare on the shadow side if the user very rarely violates that domain. Conversely, someone might have a Mythic shadow for Health if they’ve accumulated many unhealthy actions, even if their light side is struggling. The shadow ranks use the same XP thresholds as light (since the rank titles are the same). So core shadow Rare would also be ~300 shadow XP, Elite ~900, etc. This provides a parallel measure of how much “away” behavior has occurred in that domain. Importantly, away XP on core values doesn’t automatically diminish with good behavior – it’s a cumulative log of problematic actions. However, since the user will be doing more toward moves ideally, their light rank should outpace shadow over time. Shadow rank serves as a reminder of challenges or “damage” done in that domain. Example: A user might see Health: Legendary (Light) / Elite (Shadow) – meaning they’ve done a lot for their health (Legendary), but also have a non-trivial history of unhealthy choices (Elite shadow). The goal would be to keep raising the light side and slowing the growth of the shadow side. Design Note: We choose to keep light and shadow XP separate (rather than subtracting one from the other) to acknowledge both the positive and negative sides. However, this can be adjusted. If desired, the system could mitigate shadow XP when positive moves follow negative moves. For instance, if a user makes an “away” move in Health but then quickly does a “toward” move, we might reduce the recorded shadow XP (say, only 10% of the away XP counts, effectively a 90% penalty reduction for quickly correcting course). This way, quick course-correction nearly negates the slip-up. Such a rule could be implemented by holding away XP in a temporary buffer and only applying it at day’s end if not countered by any positive move. This adds forgiveness into the system, ensuring that one mistake doesn’t weigh too heavily if the user is back on track soon after. Path Level (Global Level) The Path Level (PL) represents the user’s overall level on their life path. It’s like the “character level” in an RPG – always increasing, with no upper limit. This is a single number that grows as the user gains experience across all values and domains. Key properties of Path Level: Infinite & Linear Progression: Path Level is unbounded; users can always level up further. The XP required for each new level is constant (linear growth) rather than increasing exponentially. This ensures steady, predictable progress – every level is the same size step. Path XP (Global XP): We maintain a Global XP counter that tracks cumulative value-oriented experience. Every time the user earns Value XP (by doing a toward move), this global counter also increases. In simplest terms, you can think of Global XP as the sum of all Toward Value XP the user has earned (across all personal values). For example, if the user did 8 toward moves today (8 total XP spread among various values), that’s +8 Global XP. XP per Level: The amount of Global XP required per Path Level should be tuned to the expected activity rate. With our calibrated system, we can set ~600 Global XP per level as a baseline. This means once the user accumulates 600 Global (toward) XP, they reach Path Level 1; at 1200 XP, Path Level 2; and so on. At ~5–10 actions per day, 600 XP would accumulate in roughly 2–4 months. This pace makes leveling significant but achievable – a few Path Levels per year with consistent activity. (We can adjust this number. Lowering it makes leveling faster; raising it slows it down. For example, 300 XP/level would roughly halve the time needed per level, giving more frequent level-ups.) Starting Point: Typically the user starts at Path Level 0 (or 1) with 0 Global XP. The first level-up is intentionally set to be reachable without an extremely long wait (to provide an early sense of progress). For instance, if needed XP for level = 600, a highly active user (10 actions/day) could level up in ~60 days, and even a light user (5/day) in ~120 days. If we want an even quicker initial level, we could design Level 1 to require less (a common technique is to have the first one or two levels cheaper, then plateau at a constant rate). Shadow Path Score and Level We also track the Shadow Path XP – the cumulative “away move” points across all domains. This can similarly be converted into a Shadow Path Level (SPL) using the same scale (e.g. every 600 away-XP = 1 shadow level). Shadow Path Level represents the overall level of misalignment or the “dark path” the user has taken alongside their valued path. In normal play, we expect Shadow Path Level to grow much slower than Path Level (if the user is mostly doing toward moves). Ideally, a user might be Path Level 5 with only Shadow Path Level 1, for example. But if someone struggles and does many away moves, the shadow level gives a tangible number reflecting that accumulated detriment. Like with core values, shadow path XP doesn’t automatically decrease. However, designers could implement mitigating rules (such as requiring significantly more away XP to actually gain a shadow level if the user is also doing positive moves). One forgiving approach: only count, say, 10% of away XP toward the Shadow Path if a positive action follows quickly, as mentioned earlier. This way Shadow Path Level mostly climbs if the user consistently goes off track for a while. Character Stats (Psychological Skills) To represent the user’s personal development skills and mindset, we have six key statistic gauges. Each stat corresponds to a core process in psychological flexibility (an ACT concept): Psychological Flexibility – light stat (positive). Psychological Inflexibility – shadow stat (negative). Acceptance – light stat. Experiential Avoidance – shadow stat. Cognitive Defusion – light stat. Cognitive Fusion – shadow stat. Mindfulness – light stat. Autopilot (Mindlessness) – shadow stat. Values Alignment – light stat. Values Disconnection – shadow stat. Committed Action – light stat. Avoidant Inaction – shadow stat. Each pair represents a continuum. For example, as the user practices Acceptance, that stat will rise; if they often avoid experiences, the Experiential Avoidance (shadow) stat will rise. The light stats only increase (we don’t reduce your recorded Acceptance level for a slip-up; we instead raise the avoidance side), whereas the shadow stats can both increase (when you engage in unhelpful behavior) and decrease (when you counteract it with positive behavior). Stat Values and Growth Scale: Stats are measured as numeric scores. We can start by visualizing them on a 0–100 scale for ease of understanding (e.g. 100 would be an extremely high level of that quality). However, there is no hard cap – the stats can grow beyond 100. The scale is essentially open-ended, so a user can continue improving their stats indefinitely. For practical display, we might show values over 100 as is, or consider 100 as a milestone (like “100+”). But the key is we do not impose a maximum; there is always room to grow. XP to Stat Conversion: Each stat has an associated XP counter (separate from value XP). For example, Acceptance XP accumulates when the user practices acceptance in the face of difficulty, and Experiential Avoidance XP accumulates when the user avoids feelings or situations. We translate XP into the displayed stat score. A simple model: Every 50 XP in a light stat yields +1 point to that stat’s displayed value. (So, 50 XP = 1 stat point.) This means early on, a few actions can raise the stat by a point or two, but higher scores require lots of practice. Similarly, every 50 XP in a shadow stat yields +1 point to that shadow stat’s score. These numbers (50 XP per point) can be tuned. We might choose 20 XP/point for faster changes or 100 XP/point for slower, depending on how granular we want the feedback. The idea is to make stat changes noticeable but not too jumpy. No Decreasing Light Stats: Light stats only move upward or stay the same; we don’t reduce your accumulated Acceptance score when you slip – once you’ve earned that growth, it’s “locked in.” This models the idea that skills, once learned, remain (even if we falter, we still have that knowledge to tap into). Dynamic Shadow Stats: Shadow stats, on the other hand, can increase with negative behaviors and decrease when positive behavior counteracts them. For instance, if a user has built up 10 points in Avoidant Inaction (from procrastinating or avoiding commitments), and then they start taking committed actions consistently, we might gradually reduce that Avoidant Inaction score (as the user proves they’re overcoming avoidance). In practice, this could mean deducting some shadow stat XP whenever a toward move is made. The exact mechanism could be: Every time a toward move relevant to that stat’s domain occurs, subtract some amount of shadow XP (e.g. 10 XP) from the corresponding shadow stat before adding to the light stat. This way, the shadow stat’s displayed value will drop over time as the user counters it with opposite behavior. The shadow stat score should not instantly drop to 0 from one good action (just as one slip doesn’t instantly create a huge problem). But steady positive actions will whittle away the accumulated shadow XP. Example: Suppose the user’s Mindfulness stat is 40, and their Autopilot (mindlessness) shadow stat is 20. If they begin a daily mindfulness meditation habit: Each session might give +5 Mindfulness XP (after 10 sessions, +1 point to Mindfulness stat). We could also deduct, say, 5 Autopilot XP per session, so after 10 sessions, Autopilot loses perhaps 1 point. Over weeks, Mindfulness might climb to 50, while Autopilot drops to 15, indicating growth in mindful awareness and reduction in mindless behavior. By having separate stats for the light and shadow sides, the user can see both their strengths and the areas where problematic habits still linger. There’s no fixed upper limit: even if a stat crosses 100, it can keep going (we might introduce new labels or simply show the number going past 100). Toward vs. Away: How Actions Translate to XP Whenever the user logs an action, the system will allocate XP to various subsystems as follows: Toward Move (value-consistent action): Example: You went for a run (toward Health), which aligns with your personal value of “Fitness.” Personal Value XP: +1 (or more, if the action is particularly significant) to the specific personal value (“Fitness”). Core Value XP (Light): +1 to the core category (Health) associated with that value. Global XP: +1 to the Global Toward XP pool (Path Level progress). Stat XP (Light): +XP to one or more relevant light stats. (E.g. the run might give +1 to Committed Action for following through on a goal, +1 to Mindfulness if it was a mindful run, etc., depending on context.) Stat XP (Shadow): Optionally, decrease some shadow stat XP if appropriate. (E.g. doing the run might reduce Experiential Avoidance XP a bit, since you didn’t avoid exercise.) Shadow trackers: No direct addition to any shadow XP, since this was a positive action. In fact, if a recent away move had been “pending” a penalty, this toward move could neutralize most of that penalty (as per the mitigation rule discussed). Away Move (values-inconsistent action): Example: You spent all night playing video games, neglecting sleep and work (away move for Health and Work values). Personal Value XP: Usually 0 XP to any personal value, since this didn’t contribute to a value (or possibly a very small token amount in some cases if we log it, but generally no gain). We do not deduct XP from the personal values; they just don’t advance from this action. Core Value XP (Shadow): +1 (or more, if significant) to the shadow XP of the relevant core values (e.g. +1 to Health’s shadow, +1 to Work’s shadow in this example, since it impacted both domains negatively). Global Shadow XP: +1 to the Shadow Path XP pool (overall away progress). This contributes to Shadow Path Level. Stat XP (Shadow): +XP to relevant shadow stats. (E.g. that avoidance of responsibility could yield +1 Experiential Avoidance, and choosing immediate comfort over values might give +1 to Inaction or Fusion, etc.) Stat XP (Light): No gain to light stats from this action. Possibly, in some implementations, an away move could even temporarily halt further light stat growth until a corrective action is taken (though we’ve decided not to directly decrease light stat totals). Mitigation: If the user turns around and does something positive soon after, we can soften the impact. For instance, say the system flags a +1 Shadow Path XP from this; if the user next day goes to the gym or gets a solid work session (toward moves in the domains they neglected), we might reduce that pending shadow XP by 90%. So only +0.1 actually gets recorded (or we remove it entirely). This encourages users to make a corrective toward move quickly to essentially “redeem” the away move, limiting the lasting damage on their record. By clearly delineating how each action affects the various progression metrics, the user gets immediate feedback: a toward move makes numbers go up in desirable places, an away move makes other (shadow) numbers go up. The net effect is reflected in the Integrity Rating. Integrity Rating (Overall Score) The Integrity Rating (IR) is the composite “power level” of the user’s character – it summarizes how well they are doing overall, taking into account both positive progress and the shadow elements. The name “Integrity” is used in the sense of being whole or in alignment (living with integrity to one’s values). We want this number to go up as the user grows, but it will be held back by unresolved shadow factors. Characteristics: Unified Score: IR is a single number that increases with each positive achievement (levels, ranks, stat gains) and decreases (or is offset) by negative accruals (shadow XP). It allows quick comparison (with oneself over time, or potentially with others in a friendly way) of overall growth. No Upper Limit: There is no cap to Integrity Rating. It can theoretically go into the thousands or more as the user continues to progress. This makes it suitable for long-term progression and even seasonal “high score” tracking if needed. Dynamic Calculation: Rather than having its own XP bar, IR is calculated from the state of all other metrics. Think of it as a weighted sum of all achievements minus setbacks. Calculating Integrity Rating We assign point values to each component of progress. A possible formula (which can be fine-tuned) is: Base from Path Level: Start with points from Path Level. For example, give 10 points per Path Level. (Path Level itself is a big-picture indicator of how much the user has done in total.) Core Value Contribution: Add points for each Core Value’s light rank, and subtract points for each Core Value’s shadow rank. We can use the rank tiers to assign points: Common = 1 point, Rare = 2, Elite = 3, Legendary = 4, Mythic = 5, Ascended = 6, and each Ascended star = +0.5. Enlightenment levels beyond give 7 + 0.5×level (e.g. Enlightenment 1 = 7.5, Enlightenment 2 = 8.0, etc.). Calculate a core light score = sum of points for all four core values’ light ranks. Calculate a core shadow score = sum of points for all core values’ shadow ranks. We might weight core values more heavily since they represent broad life fulfillment. For instance, multiply these by 5: Core Contribution = (core_light_score – core_shadow_score) × 5. Stat Contribution: Add up the user’s light stat values and subtract the shadow stat values. For example, if the user’s six light stats sum to 240 and their six shadow stats sum to 60, the net stat contribution is 180. We can optionally scale this down if we feel stats are overly numerous. For example, we might take 0.5 point per stat point to half their effect (or leave it at 1:1 if we want stats fully counted). Let’s say we choose to half it: Stat Contribution = 0.5 × (total_light_stats – total_shadow_stats). Shadow Path Penalty: Subtract points for overall shadow path level. For example, –10 points per Shadow Path Level (mirroring the +10 per Path Level on the positive side). This means if a user has a Shadow Path Level of 2, that’s –20 points to IR, offsetting some positives. (Optionally, we could also include personal value progress in a detailed way, but since Path Level already aggregates all value XP, and core covers the domain mastery, we usually don’t count each sub-value separately in IR to avoid double-counting. However, one might include something like average personal value rank if desired for nuance.) Now, sum everything up: Integrity Rating = (Path Level × 10) + 5 × (core_light_score – core_shadow_score) + 0.5 × (sum of light stat values – sum of shadow stat values) + (–10 × Shadow Path Level) This formula captures all aspects: Path Level (breadth of experience) adds. High core value ranks add a lot, high shadow ranks subtract a lot (since we weight core by 5, a full rank difference can mean 5–10 point swings). Strong psychological skills add to IR; high levels of problematic tendencies subtract from IR. If the user has many away moves raising their shadow path, it pulls IR down, whereas a user with minimal away history won’t have that penalty. Adjustment and balance: The weights (10 points per level, 5× for core, 0.5× for stats, etc.) are chosen so that no single category overwhelms the score. For example, stats are numerous (six stats that can each go 100+), hence we chose to half their impact so that having, say, +200 total stat points yields +100 IR points, which is on the order of a few Path Levels or a couple of core rank ups – significant but not everything. Core values are weighted strongly because being Legendary or Enlightened in a core domain is a big deal for one’s life – we want IR to reflect that heavily. Path Level ensures that even if someone spreads their efforts widely (jack of all trades), it still counts. Integrity Rating in practice: A user new to the system might start at IR ~0 and quickly climb into the tens as they gain a few ranks and stat points. A well-balanced user who has moderate Path Level, mostly positive core ranks, and decent stats might have an IR in the hundreds. Someone who grinds a lot of actions (high Path Level) but also has significant shadow issues might see that the shadow elements keep their IR lower than it could be, encouraging them to not just “do a lot,” but to address the areas where they’re faltering. Crucially, IR gives a big-picture summary. If it’s increasing over time, the user knows that overall they’re on the right track (even if occasionally a rank might not change or a stat dips, the upward trend of IR is reinforcing). If IR stagnates or drops, it’s a signal to check where the shadow might be weighing things down. Progression Pace and Balance Considerations This system is tuned so that progress feels rewarding and visible in the short term, yet also sustainable for the long term: Early Momentum: Initial ranks (e.g. going from Common → Rare on a personal value) happen quickly – on the order of days to a week – to hook the user with a sense of achievement. Early Path Level ups could also be made faster (if desired, by setting a lower XP requirement for the first level) to ensure the user sees their Path Level tick up within the first month or two of use. Medium-Term Goals: Intermediate ranks like Legendary/Mythic on personal values provide medium-term targets (1–3 months of effort). Similarly, achieving Rare or Elite on a Core Value might be a milestone after a few months of consistent focus on that life area. These keep the user engaged after the initial novelty. Long-Term Mastery: Higher tiers such as Ascended or Enlightenment are long-term goals that could take many months or years, reflecting true mastery and life-changing levels of growth. By the time a user reaches those, they will have derived a lot of value from the process itself. Balanced Difficulty: We adjusted the earlier proposed multipliers (12× for core, 48× for global) down to more reasonable values (around 6× for core, 12× for global) so that users can actually see progress in core values and global level within a motivating timeframe. The numbers can always be tweaked with testing, but the presented values aim for a balance where: A dedicated user working on a particular value daily can reach Mythic in ~2–3 months (so there are tangible high-level achievements each quarter, for example). That same effort might get their related Core Value to maybe Elite or Legendary in that time, with Core Mythic taking significantly longer (perhaps the better part of a year or more). The user’s Path Level would inch up every few months, providing a steady overarching progress indicator. No Ceilings on Growth: By allowing Enlightenment levels (in values) and stats to grow without cap, we ensure that progress never truly ends. A user can always push a little further, set new personal bests, and continue the journey. The Integrity Rating likewise will continue to rise as they improve (especially since Enlightenment levels keep contributing and stats can always increase). Seasonal Reset (if applicable): While the core progression is persistent, the design allows for seasonal gamification. For example, the app could run monthly or quarterly “Integrity Challenges” where users are ranked by IR gain or by specific achievements, effectively creating seasons. IR itself doesn’t reset (it’s a lifetime score), but you might snapshot it for competitive purposes. This was alluded to with the idea of adding a rank representation in seasons – something that can be layered on later without altering the foundational XP system. In summary, this leveling system provides a comprehensive, ACT-aligned gamification of personal growth: It gives immediate feedback for small actions (via personal value XP and stat gains). It charts meaningful medium- and long-term progress (via core value ranks and path level). It acknowledges setbacks (through shadow XP and shadow ranks) but offers mechanisms to overcome them (by not punishing light XP and allowing shadow mitigation). And finally, it synthesizes everything into one Integrity Rating that can inspire the user to keep all aspects of their growth in balance.
